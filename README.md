A bit about me -

- 💻   I’m currently working as a Data Scientist & ML Engineer at [Zaplabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWpbIKS7FE) in the picturesque San Francisco Bay Area. 🌁  Though I loved the view from office overlooking the Golden Gate, I equally enjoy the comfort of working from home, given the current shelter-in-place situation. 
- 🕒   Previously, I've worked at [SAP Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ftF5kpBKj0) in Palo Alto, at Anthem (with the Obamacare team), the Indian Institute of Science and General Electric.
- 🌱   I’m currently learning to work with Streamlit, AWS ML Tools and Go.
- 👯  I’m happy to collaborate on cool, open source Data Science/ML projects.
- 🤔  I’m looking for help with best practices of managing a Data Science team and streamlining ML workflows.
- 🎓  I studied Computer Science at Indiana University in Bloomington. 
- 💬  Ask me how I prepare the world's best Chai.
